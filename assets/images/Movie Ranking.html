 <h2>Top 3 Anime</h2>

 <h3>1. Attack on Titan Series</h3>
<p>Probably one of the best shows to watch. Its thrilling and heartwrenching scenes are
    amazing. If some one loves shows with betrayals and emotional encounters, than I think
    it is the best show to watch. The suspense and action this show brings alongwith great
    animation to its audience is just to whole other level. And if we look at the voice actors
    whether they are from original or dubbed, both did a splendid job.

<h3>2. Death Note</h3>
<p>
    When it comes to thrillers and suspense. There is not match to this series.Absolutely mind blowing. 
    Every new episode comes with a new suspense and turn in the series. The voice acting is 
    absolutely mind blowing and fantastic. 
</p>

<h3>3. Dragon Ball Series</h3>
<p>
    When it to Dragon ball series,biasness is something which really matters. Because this is my
    first and personal favourite Anime. I love this series as it is so close to my heart. Its 
    action and fightscenes are best in the whole industry. The heroes and villains of the
    seriesare so iconic that almost everyone who watched anime knows them
